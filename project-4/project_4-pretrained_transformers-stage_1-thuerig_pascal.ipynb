    "## Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenizer\n",
    "In this project, the `AutoTokenizer` from the Hugging Face Transformers library is used to handle text preprocessing. Specifically, the `bert-base-cased` associated with the \"bert-base-cased\" model is instantiated. This tokenizer manages:\n",
    "- Whitespace and special character removal.\n",
    "- Retaining case sensitivity to preserve semantic meaning.\n",
    "- Padding and truncation to ensure sequences are within the 512-token limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tokenization Details\n",
    "- **Questions:** The length of questions is capped at 21 tokens, based on dataset analysis.\n",
    "- **Passages:** Passages are padded or truncated to ensure the overall sequence remains within the 512-token limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling OOV words\n",
    "The BERT Tokenizer utilizes a WordPiece tokenization strategy. Words not present in the vocabulary are decomposed into subword units. For example, an unknown word like \"unhappiness\" might be tokenized into \"un\", \"##happiness\". This approach ensures that even unseen words are represented through known subword components.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Padding and Truncation\n",
    "Sequences are padded to a maximum length of 512 tokens, aligning with BERT's architecture constraints. Padding is applied to the maximum sequence length, not just the length of the longest sequence in a batch. This approach ensures consistent input dimensions across all batches, prioritizing simplicity and uniformity over computational efficiency. While dynamic batch padding could improve efficiency and reduce memory usage, the focus of this project is not on optimizing transformer models for efficiency. Therefore, fixed padding is used to streamline implementation and maintain uniformity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case Sensitivity\n",
    "The \"bert-base-cased\" tokenizer is case-sensitive, distinguishing between words like \"Apple\" and \"apple\". This sensitivity preserves the semantic nuances of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embedding Layer\n",
    "The model leverages the pre-trained embeddings form the \"bert-base-cased\" model. These embeddings are fine-tuned during training to adapt to the specific nuances of the BoolQ dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positional Embeddings\n",
    "BERT inherently incorporates positional embeddings, unlike the transformer encoder in the last project, to capture the order of tokens in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input / Output / Label Format\n",
    "Each data point consists of a question, passage, and binary label (True/False). The preprocessing transforms these into the following formats:\n",
    "- **Tokenization**:\n",
    "    - *input*: Concatenated question and passage with `[CLS]` at the start, and `[SEP]` is placed between and at the end of the concatenated sequence.\n",
    "    - *output*: Tokenized sequences with attention masks:\n",
    "        - `input_ids`: Tensor of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, representing token IDs.\n",
    "        - `attention_mask`: Tensor of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, indicating non-padded tokens.\n",
    "- **Transformer Encoder**:\n",
    "    - *input*: Tokenized `input_ids` and `attention_mask` tensors with shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.\n",
    "    - *output*: Contextualized embeddings from the final encoder layer of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_dim)`.\n",
    "- **Classifier**:\n",
    "    - *input*: The embedding corresponding to the `[CLS]` token with shape `(batch_size, hidden_dim)`.\n",
    "    - *output*: A single logit per data point with shape `(batch_size, 1)`, representing the probability of the label being True.\n",
    "- **Label format**:\n",
    "    - Binary labels are encoded as integers (`0` for False, `1` for True)."

    "\n",
    "My last project went decently well, beating the majority class accuracy of 62.17% on the test set. Before writing this interpretation i toyed around with the `bert-large-cased` model, implementing and running it as quickly as possible just to see what it could do. With 333 Million parameters in the transformer model I had to use a `batch_size` of 16 to not run out of memory. Giving it a single run over the weekend, with \"looks about right\" choice for hyperparameters, it managed to reach a test accuracy of 72.63% after over 23 hours of runtime. Impressed by this result I am setting my expectations for the properly implemented and fine-tuned `bert-base-cased` model to reach a test accuracy of 69%. Nice."
