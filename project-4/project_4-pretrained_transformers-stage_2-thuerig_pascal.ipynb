    "## <span style=\"color: orange;\">TLDR - Executive summary</span>\n",
    "### **Topic:**\n",
    "Implement and train a pre-trained Transformer model end to end for binary question answering on the BoolQ dataset from Hugging Face.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data:**\n",
    "The dataset is for reading comprehension and question answering tasks. It consists of questions, passages, and the corresponding yes/no answers, with separate training and test splits. For this project, the last 1000 entries of the training split were set aside to use as a validation split. Class imbalance was observed across the splits, with approximately 62% of samples labeled \"yes\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Methods:**\n",
    "The project involves preprocessing the data using the `AutoTokenizer` that instantiates the correct tokenizer with the pre-trained `bert-base-cased` model. Using the `[CLS]` token from bert-base-cased model output as the input for my two-layer classifier with ReLU and a dropout layer inbetween both layers to finally receive the binary output. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Model:**\n",
    "The model is based on a `bert-base-cased` model from Hugging Face and is structured as follows:\n",
    "- **Bert Transformer**: Used without modification, with the training mode enabled.\n",
    "- **Classifier**: A two-layer classifier with ReLU non-linearity and a dropout layer.\n",
    "- **Loss Function**: Binary Cross-Entropy Loss `BCELoss`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Experiments:**\n",
    "Link to WandB: [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/aintnoair/nlp-p4-pretrained_transformers/reports/Pre-trained-Transformers--VmlldzoxMDMzNDA4OA) <br>\n",
    "Initial manual testing runs were conducted to verify the model’s functionality, followed by hyperparameter optimization using Optuna (5 trials due to time constraints). The ranges explored were:\n",
    "- learning_rate: 1e-6, 1e-3\n",
    "- hidden_dim: 64, 512, step=64\n",
    "- dropout_rate: 0.0, 0.5\n",
    "- weight_decay: 1e-6, 1e-2\n",
    "- warmup_ratio: 0.0, 0.1 (percentage of total training steps)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Results:**\n",
    "Key findings:\n",
    "- The best model achieved a validation accuracy of **73.60%** and a test accuracy of **72.63%**, significantly outperforming the majority baseline test accuracy of **62.17%**.\n",
    "-  model effectively addressed overfitting using a dropout rate of **0.2077** and weight decay of **7.37e-05**.\n",
    "- A smaller `bert-base-cased` model, when fine-tuned with optimized hyperparameters, matched the larger `bert-large-cased` model, which achieved a test accuracy of **72.63%**. This highlights the importance of careful hyperparameter tuning over simply scaling up model size.\n",
    "- Despite strong overall performance, the model showed a slight bias toward the majority \"yes\" class, attributed to the class imbalance in the dataset.\n"

    "## Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenizer\n",
    "In this project, the `AutoTokenizer` from the Hugging Face Transformers library is used to handle text preprocessing. Specifically, the `bert-base-cased` associated with the \"bert-base-cased\" model is instantiated. This tokenizer manages:\n",
    "- Whitespace and special character removal.\n",
    "- Retaining case sensitivity to preserve semantic meaning.\n",
    "- Padding and truncation to ensure sequences are within the 512-token limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tokenization Details\n",
    "- **Questions:** The length of questions is capped at 21 tokens, based on dataset analysis.\n",
    "- **Passages:** Passages are padded or truncated to ensure the overall sequence remains within the 512-token limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling OOV words\n",
    "The BERT Tokenizer utilizes a WordPiece tokenization strategy. Words not present in the vocabulary are decomposed into subword units. For example, an unknown word like \"unhappiness\" might be tokenized into \"un\", \"##happiness\". This approach ensures that even unseen words are represented through known subword components.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Padding and Truncation\n",
    "Sequences are padded to a maximum length of 512 tokens, aligning with BERT's architecture constraints. ~~Padding is applied to the maximum sequence length, not just the length of the longest sequence in a batch. This approach ensures consistent input dimensions across all batches, prioritizing simplicity and uniformity over computational efficiency. While dynamic batch padding could improve efficiency and reduce memory usage, the focus of this project is not on optimizing transformer models for efficiency. Therefore, fixed padding is used to streamline implementation and maintain uniformity.~~\n",
    "<span style=\"color: orange;\">Correction: I got dynamic padding working, so I implemented that to save on hardware resources and speed up training.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case Sensitivity\n",
    "The \"bert-base-cased\" tokenizer is case-sensitive, distinguishing between words like \"Apple\" and \"apple\". This sensitivity preserves the semantic nuances of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embedding Layer\n",
    "The model leverages the pre-trained embeddings form the \"bert-base-cased\" model. These embeddings are fine-tuned during training to adapt to the specific nuances of the BoolQ dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positional Embeddings\n",
    "BERT inherently incorporates positional embeddings, unlike the transformer encoder in the last project, to capture the order of tokens in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input / Output / Label Format\n",
    "Each data point consists of a question, passage, and binary label (True/False). The preprocessing transforms these into the following formats:\n",
    "- **Tokenization**:\n",
    "    - *input*: Concatenated question and passage with `[CLS]` at the start, and `[SEP]` is placed between and at the end of the concatenated sequence.\n",
    "    - *output*: Tokenized sequences with attention masks:\n",
    "        - `input_ids`: Tensor of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, representing token IDs.\n",
    "        - `attention_mask`: Tensor of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, indicating non-padded tokens.\n",
    "- **Transformer Encoder**:\n",
    "    - *input*: Tokenized `input_ids` and `attention_mask` tensors with shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.\n",
    "    - *output*: Contextualized embeddings from the final encoder layer of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_dim)`.\n",
    "- **Classifier**:\n",
    "    - *input*: The embedding corresponding to the `[CLS]` token with shape `(batch_size, hidden_dim)`.\n",
    "    - *output*: A single logit per data point with shape `(batch_size, 1)`, representing the probability of the label being True.\n",
    "- **Label format**:\n",
    "    - Binary labels are encoded as integers (`0` for False, `1` for True)."

    "### Architecture\n",
    "- **Pretrained Transformer Encoder:**\n",
    "  - Hugging Face’s `bert-base-cased` processes tokenized inputs.\n",
    "  - The output corresponding to the `[CLS]` token is extracted as a fixed-size representation.\n",
    "  - *The `bert-base-cased` model is pretrained using a masked language modeling and next sentence prediction objective and not question answering. This is why I deem it usable for this project where fine-tuned pretrained models are not allowed.*\n",
    "- **Classifier:**\n",
    "  - A two-layer fully connected network processes the `[CLS]` token embedding:\n",
    "    - **First Layer:** Projects the embedding to the hidden dimension with ReLU activation.\n",
    "    - **Dropout Layer:** Introduced after ReLU to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "    - **Second Layer:** Maps the hidden representation to a single binary output using Sigmoid activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Function\n",
    "The Binary Cross-Entropy Loss (BCE) function is used to calculate the difference between predicted and true labels for binary classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimizer\n",
    "*Learning rates stated here are for testing model functionality. Hyperparameters for experiments stated in `Experiments`.*\n",
    "- **AdamW Optimizer:**\n",
    "  - A learning rate of `2e-5` is used for the Transformer encoder.\n",
    "  - A higher learning rate of `2e-4` is applied to the classifier layers to allow faster convergence.\n",
    "  - <span style=\"color: orange;\">These learning rates were only en example to demonstrate the classifier lr is 10x of the transformer lr.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checkpointing and Early Stopping\n",
    "- **Checkpointing:** Save the model with the best validation accuracy. Criteria for this will be the maximum validation accuracy.\n",
    "- **Early Stopping:** Terminates training if validation loss does not improve for <span style=\"color: orange;\">5</span> consecutive epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correctness Tests\n",
    "- **Tokenization**:\n",
    "    - Ensure the tokenized output does not exceed 512 tokens.\n",
    "    - Verify alignment between `input_ids` and `attention_mask` dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DataLoader**:\n",
    "    - Verify batch size consistency during data loading.\n",
    "    - Check that the output tensors for `input_ids` and `attention_mask` match the expected batch size and sequence length.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Input/Output**:\n",
    "    - Confirm the input to the Transformer encoder has the shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.\n",
    "    - Validate that the output of the Transformer encoder has the shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_dim)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classifier Dimensions**:\n",
    "    - Check that the input to the classifier corresponds to the `[CLS]` token embedding with shape `(batch_size, hidden_dim)`.\n",
    "    - Ensure the output of the classifier has the shape `(batch_size, 1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reproducibility**:\n",
    "    - Validate consistent results across multiple runs with the same random seed.\n"

    "To understand why the model may fail on certain predictions, I will conduct an error analysis investigating weather miss classifications are related to the confidence score the model has in its predictions.

    "Opting to forego manual preprocessing and instead utilizing the built-in functionality of the AutoTokenizer module to manage padding, truncation, extra whitespace removal, special character handling, and case sensitivity proved successful. This approach simplified the implementation and minimized the risk of errors.\n",

    "### Data Imbalance Analysis\n",
    "An exploration of the dataset revealed a significant class imbalance across the training, validation, and test sets. The proportion of \"yes\" labels is consistently higher across all splits:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training set: 62.64% \"yes\" (1.68 ratio)\n",
    "Validation set: 59.5% \"yes\" (1.47 ratio)\n",
    "Test set: 62.17% \"yes\" (1.64 ratio)\n",
    "This imbalance likely contributed to the model's tendency to predominantly predict the majority \"yes\" class, especially in the early stages of training. Without adjustments to address this imbalance, the model achieved a validation accuracy of approximately XXXXXXX% but failed to learn nuanced patterns in the minority \"no\" class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, I incorporated dropout, weight decay, and adjusted the learning rate during training. Additionally, I experimented with hyperparameter tuning using Optuna to optimize the model's performance further.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error and Confusion Matrix Analysis\n",
    "The best-performing model from the Optuna trials achieved a validation accuracy of **73.60%** and a test accuracy of **72.63%**, significantly outperforming the baseline test accuracy of **62.17%**. The final model's run parameters were as follows:\n",

    "    - Patience: 5 epochs\n",
    "    - Max epochs: 10\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of the confusion matrix revealed that while the model improved in predicting the minority \"no\" class compared to earlier runs, a slight bias toward the majority \"yes\" class persisted. This suggests that further techniques, such as weighted loss functions or oversampling the minority class, could enhance performance further. It was also interesting to see how the model improved over time when plotting the validation confusion matrix every epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Accuracy and Overfitting\n",
    "The model reached a training accuracy of approximately 98.9% within 5–6 epochs, highlighting its capacity to fit the training data effectively. However, the gap between training and validation accuracy persisted, indicating some degree of overfitting despite applying dropout and weight decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison of BERT Models\n",
    "The `bert-base-cased` model tuned with Optuna matched the \"Hail Mary\" `bert-large-cased` model, which achieved a validation accuracy of 72.60% and a test accuracy of 72.63%. Surprisingly, the smaller model not only matched but slightly surpassed the larger model's test performance, all while being significantly faster and more resource-efficient to train. This result emphasizes the importance of fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization over simply scaling up model size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation on the test set\n",
    "The final model achieved a test accuracy of **72.63%**, marking a substantial improvement over the baseline of **62.17%**. While the model's performance is promising, the persistent imbalance in predictions suggests room for further optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations for Future Projects\n",
    "To further address the class imbalance, future iterations could explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weighted Loss Functions**: Assigning higher weights to the minority \"no\" class to encourage the model to learn its patterns more effectively.\n",
    "- **Focal Loss**: Adjusting the loss function to focus more on harder-to-classify examples.\n",
    "Additionally, incorporating adversarial training or experimenting with ensemble methods could help the model better generalize to unseen data. Despite its limitations, the fine-tuned bert-base-cased model demonstrates promising performance and efficiency for the BoolQ dataset."

    "## Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "My last project went decently well, beating the majority class accuracy of 62.17% on the test set. Before writing this interpretation I toyed around with the `bert-large-cased` model, implementing and running it as quickly as possible just to see what it could do. With 333 Million parameters in the transformer model I had to use a `batch_size` of 16 to not run out of memory. Giving it a single run over the weekend, with \"looks about right\" choice for hyperparameters, it managed to reach a test accuracy of 72.63% after over 23 hours of runtime. Impressed by this result I am setting my expectations for the properly implemented and fine-tuned `bert-base-cased` model to reach a test accuracy of 69%. Nice."

    "Before beginning this project, I set my expectations for the `bert-base-cased` model to reach a test accuracy of around **69%**, based on my preliminary \"Hail Mary\" run with the `bert-large-cased` model, which achieved a test accuracy of **72.63%**. To my surprise, the fine-tuned bert-base-cased model not only met but exceeded these expectations, achieving a validation accuracy of **73.60%** and a test accuracy of **72.63%**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result demonstrates that a smaller, well-tuned model can match or outperform a larger model on tasks like BoolQ, where dataset size and complexity may not fully leverage the additional capacity of a large model. The ability to fine-tune the base model with limited computational resources and achieve comparable results to the bert-large-cased model, which has 333 million parameters, highlights the efficiency of proper hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key takeaway from this project is the importance of addressing dataset imbalances. While the model performed admirably overall, the persistent bias toward the majority \"yes\" class suggests that the imbalanced label distribution limited its ability to fully capture patterns in the minority \"no\" class. Techniques such as class weighting, focal loss, or oversampling could be valuable avenues for future improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this project showcased the power of fine-tuning smaller models and the significant impact of systematic hyperparameter optimization. While there is still room for improvement in mitigating overfitting and handling class imbalance, the results are a strong step forward in tackling the BoolQ dataset with pretrained Transformers."
