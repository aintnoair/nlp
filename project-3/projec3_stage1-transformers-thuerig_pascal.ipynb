    "## Preprocessing\n",
    "### Tokenizer\n",
    "In past projects I always did some sort of manual preprocessing of the data. In this project I deliberately refrain from any manual preprocessing and will let the built-in features of the AutoTokenizer with the from_pretrained(\"bert-base-cased\") model handle the following steps for me:\n",
    "- Whitespace and Special Character removal (e.g. emojis or phonetic pronunciations)\n",
    "- Case Sensitivity\n",
    "- Padding and Truncation (pad automatically, truncate to max: 512 tokens - amount of pretrained position embeddings)\n",
    "\n",
    "I only now found out about this from the Hugging Face Transformer [Preprocessing Data Documentation](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v3.0.2/preprocessing.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lowercase / Case Sensitivity\n",
    "From my feedback I will now keep case sensitivity instead of lower-casing all text. Example of case sensitivity: the word \"US\" would become \"us\" and could thus change the meaning of a sentence drastically. <br>\n",
    "*Source*: Feedback from Project 2 (LSTM)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Padding / Truncation\n",
    "I rely on the built-in padding and truncation functions of the AutoTokenizer from Hugging Face to manage sequence lengths efficiently:\n",
    "- Questions are limited to a maximum of 21 tokens, based on the length of the longest question in the dataset.\n",
    "- Passages are padded to a maximum of 488 tokens, ensuring that when the question (21 tokens), start token, end token, and separator token are included, the total length remains within the 512-token limit supported by the Transformer’s positional embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stemming / Lemmatization / Stopword removal\n",
    "From a past lecture I took away that stemming or lemmatization is not the right choice for a reading comprehension task. It removes valuable meaning\n",
    "No stemming or lemmatization will be done in my preprocessing as to keep the most amount of information possible in my sequences. Stopwords will also not be removed for the same reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embedding Layer\n",
    "In this project, the embedding layer is implemented using PyTorch's nn.Embedding class. The embeddings are trained end-to-end alongside the rest of the model, allowing them to adapt to the specific nuances of the BoolQ dataset.\n",
    "- **Vocabulary Size**: Determined by the tokenizer\n",
    "- **Embedding Dimension**: Set to 300 as this is widely used by large pretrained embedding models like fastText or word2vec.\n",
    "- **Training**: Initialized randomly and updated during training through backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Absolute Position Embeddings\n",
    "Since the nn.TransformerEncoder does not by default have positional embeddings I will be implementing them through absolute position embeddings. Choosing the embeddings over the encoding because it is more widely used in practice.\n",
    "Adding the learned absolute positional embeddings to the word embeddings before feeding the input into the transformer model. The position embeddings are initialized randomly and are trained with the model through backpropagation.\n",
    "*Source*: Lecutre on positional encodings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input / Output / Label format\n",
    "Each data point in the dataset is made up of a questions, passage and the respective binary label. The preprocessing steps transform these into the following formats for my model inputs:\n",
    "- Embedding Layer:\n",
    "    - *input*: Tensor of (batch_size, sequence_length) containing token IDs.\n",
    "    - *output*: Tensor for (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim) with each token ID mapped to a dense vector of size embedding_dim.\n",

    "- Pooling Layer:\n",
    "    - *input*: The output of the last transformer layer, with shape (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim)\n",
    "    - *output*: A Tensor of shape (batch_size, embedding_dim), representing the aggregated sequence information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2-Layer Classifier:\n",
    "    - *input*: The pooled output, with shape (batch_size, embedding_dim)\n",
    "    - *output*: A tensor of shape (batch_size, hidden_dim) for the first layer and shape (batch_size, num_classes) for the final layer.\n",

    "- **Input Layer**:\n",
    "    - The input to my model is the nn.Embedding layer that will be trained on the dataset with the network.\n",
    "    - Each input sequence consists of a concatenated question and passage with a [SEP] token between them, marking the boundary. The separator token allows the model to distinguish between the two segments.\n",
    "    - The resulting shape of the input tensor after embedding is (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim).\n",

    "    - Using the PyTorch implementation of the Transformer Encoder. The input to this model will be the output of the embedding layer with shape (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim). Using six layers to learn contextual representations of the concatenated questino-passage sequence.\n",
    "- **Pooling Layer**:\n",
    "    - Apply *mean pooling* across the sequence length to reducing the output from (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim) to (batch_size, embedding_dim). This provides a fixed-size single vector that summarizes the entire sequence for the classifier which provides the advantage of efficient memory use in training with varying sequence lengths and a fixed-sized input for my classifier.\n",
    "- **2-Layer Classifier with ReLU**\n",
    "    - I will implement a two-layer classifier network as defined in the project assignment. The first layer will take the output from the pooling layer of size (batch_size, embedding_dim) as its input and provide an output shape of (batch_size, hidden_dim). Using a ReLU for non-linearity. The second layer has output dimensions of (batch_size, num_classes) with num_classes=2. The output layer will use a softmax as the activation function as it is preferable over a sigmoid function for binary classification.\n",

    "### Training\n",
    "I do not expect any run to take longer than 25 epochs. Thus limiting the maximum number of epochs to 25 and implement the early stopping criteria like in past projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checkpointing and Early Stopping\n",
    "**Checkpointing**: I will implement checkpointing to save the model with the best validation accuracy. Criteria for this will be the maximum validation accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Early Stopping**: Early stopping the run if the validation loss does not decreas within 15 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Planned Correctness Tests\n",
    "- Testing input shape to ensure the model receives a valid input format\n",
